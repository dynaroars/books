\chapter{Preface}
Having been involved in PhD admissions for many years, I've
realized that many \textbf{international students} (and also domestic ones), especially those in  smaller countries or less well-known universities, lack a clear understanding of
the Computer Science PhD admission process at US universities. This confusion not only
discourages students from applying but also creates the perception that
getting admitted to a CS PhD program in the US is difficult compared to other countries.

% though \emph{very} top schools could be very selective, e.g., see the \href{https://da-data.blogspot.com/2015/03/reflecting-on-cs-graduate-admissions.html}{admission process} at CMU
So I want to share some details about the admission process and advice for those who are interested in applying for a \textbf{PhD in Computer Science in the US}.
While this document is primarily intended for students interested in CS, it might be relevant to students from various disciplines.
Furthermore, although many examples are specifics for schools that I and other contributors of this document know about, the information should be generalizable to other R1\footnote{An \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_research_universities_in_the_United_States}{R1 institution} in the US is a research-intensive university with a high level of research activity across various disciplines. Currently, 146 (out of 4000) universities are classified as R1.} institutions in the US (and universities in other countries).

In addition, this document can help \textbf{US faculty and admission committee} gain a better understanding of international students and their cultural differences.  By recognizing and leveraging these differences, CS programs in the US can attract larger and more competitive application pools from international students.

I wish you the best of luck. And if you follow this guidance, you will at least have a good chance at GMU (see
\href{https://github.com/dynaroars/dynaroars.github.io/wiki/About-GMU}{why
  you want to study at here}). Happy school hunting!

\chapter{Summary}\label{sec:summary}

Below we summarize the main points of this guideline. This gives you an overview to decide which specific topics you want to explore more thoroughly.


\begin{enumerate}
  \item Should you apply?
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \emph{Yes, definitely}.  CS PhD study in the US is fully funded and admission into good universities is not any harder than non-US schools (\autoref{sec:should}).
        \end{itemize}
  \item How is your application evaluated?
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Applications are evaluated by the \emph{PhD Admission} committee and each application is reviewed by typically three faculty (\autoref{sec:evalapps}).
          \item Individually faculty \emph{cannot directly admit} a student---so do not email and ask if you have a chance. However, faculty can \emph{advocate} for a student and therefore increase their admission chance---so do contact and introduce yourself (\autoref{sec:contact}).
         \end{itemize}
  \item Application Materials
        \begin{itemize}
          \item The committee will look at various factors, but the most important ones are research ability, e.g., publications, statement of purpose (SOP), and  letters of recommendation (LORs).
          \item LORs are very important, but only if they are personalized and talk about your research ability (\autoref{sec:lor}).
          \item SOP is very important. Write it in such a way that makes you \emph{stand out} (\autoref{sec:research-statement} and \autoref{sec:improve-your-chance})
          \item GRE \emph{is not} required (\autoref{sec:grades}). Spend your time on something else!
          \item Grades are important, but depend on the reputation of your school (\autoref{sec:grades}).
          \item Getting an interview is typically a \emph{good sign} as no one wants to interview weak candidates (\autoref{sec:interview}).
        \end{itemize}
  \item What to do after getting admitted?
        \begin{itemize}
                \item  Celebrating! Now it is your turn to evaluate the school!
          \item Attend \emph{Open House} to learn more about the place and \emph{interview} profs---they would be much more willing to talk to you now (\autoref{sec:accepted}).
        \end{itemize}
  \item Funding
        \begin{itemize}
          \item TA and RA are two main funding sources.  TA (teaching assistantship) is provided by the department to help profs. with classes (e.g., grading). RA (research assistantship) is provided by profs. to help with their research (\autoref{sec:funding}).
        \end{itemize}
  \item Choosing School and Professors
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Many schools do not offer PhD studies in CS and many CS professors \emph{cannot} formally advise or graduate PhD students  (\autoref{sec:schoolsandprofs}).
          \item Contacting a prof. for research opportunities is recommended, but do it \emph{properly} (\autoref{sec:contact}).
        \end{itemize}
  \item Miscs and FAQS
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Increasing your admission chance by being unique and standing out (\autoref{sec:improve-your-chance}).
          \item You can successfully apply to CS PhD even if you have non-STEM background (\autoref{sec:non-stem}).
          \item Compared to other countries, CS PhD in the US does not require an MS degree but has longer PhD study time (\autoref{sec:non-us-differences}).
          \item Your 5--6 year PhD program costs about \$400K in total, but you \emph{do not} pay for it (\autoref{sec:ra-cost}).
          \item Despite some miserable stories on social media, many PhD students have good mentors, supportive lab mates, healthy working environment ... and are happy (\autoref{sec:happy}).
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Intro}


\section{The 5 jobs of an assistant professor}
At an R1 university, an assistant professor in CS (and likely in other fields) typically has \emph{five} jobs:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[Research] You need to do research and publish papers.  To establish yourself as an independent research, you should publish papers with your students (and not solely with your PhD or postdoc adviser).  

\item[Funding] You need to write proposal and secure funding from sponsors including government agencies (e.g., NSF) or industry.

\item[Mentoring] You need to recruit, mentor, and graduate PhD students.

\item[Teaching] You need to teach!


\item[Service]  You need to serve for your professional research communities (e.g., PC, review journals, NSF panels) and for your institution (e.g., PhD admission committees, dissertation committee).  You also need to do various other things including writing LoRs for your students (and even your peers)


\end{enumerate}


So, there you go. A new assistant prof. opening their own lab starting their academic career typically has these 5 duties.  In some sense having your own lab is like opening your own start up company. You have to work on raising funding, recruiting employees, do the actual work, etc.  You don't have a boss, but you are responsible for everything.  


\section{Pros and Cons}

Pros:
\begin{itemize}
\item Freedom. You don’t have a boss. Seriously, you don't.  You can work on any research topics you want (preferably something that can get grants), choose your own students (not that easy to find good students) and collaborators, work on your own time, and have plenty of free time(technically I only have to be "at work" for 3 hrs a week for my class from 4:15PM--7:10PM).  

\item Students. It's a great award when seeing how your students evolve to be more mature and become an expert in their research.

\item Flexibility. You can do pretty much anything.  Travels, give talks, write paper/blogs/books (like this one).  Create new courses and even online courses.  Collaborate  with academia, government, research lab, industry.  Start your own company when you retire!

\item Time with family. This might seem like a weird pro, but as a professor, I have much more
control over my time than many other jobs. It lets me schedule my work so that I can
spend more with my family. For example, when my ﬁrst kid was born, my department
gave me teaching time off so that I could spend time with him. I spent six months with
my son – irreplaceable time that is harder to get in many other jobs (this is especially
true in the USA where paternity and maternity leave is minimal in many jobs).
\end{itemize}

Cons:
\begin{itemize}
\item Responsibility: The role carries high responsibility, not only for one's own career but also for the careers of PhD students under their supervision.
\item Stress: The initial years are particularly stressful as one learns various aspects of the job while under pressure.
\item Poor financial compensation: Assistant professors typically earn less than they would in industry, leading to a significant opportunity cost over time.
\item Funding: Securing research funds requires substantial time and effort, with no guarantee of success, given the competitive nature of grant applications.
\item Culture of unpaid labor: Academia in the USA often relies on unpaid work, both from faculty and students, which can be a significant drawback compared to industry where compensation is typically fairer.
\end{itemize}

\section{Serving on NSF Panels}
You should serve on NSF panels.  It is a great way to learn about the grant process: how to distinguish between good and bad proposals and how people review propsoals.
It is also a good way learn what other people are doing, what is hot, and what is not.

\chapter{History and Acknowledgement}\label{sec:ack}

\paragraph{History} This document was conceived during a lunch with Craig Yu at GMU.  We talked on about why GMU were not able to attract good Vietnamese and other international students, despite having a much stronger CS program than many schools that these students want to go to (part of the reason is described in \autoref{sec:selecting-ranking-schools}). We wished there were a way for international students to know about the US PhD programs (also for US faculty to understand more about international students and therefore have better chance of recruiting and working with them). I was also a member of the large VietPhD group on Facebook and saw many questions from students about PhD programs.  However, most active participant are students in non-CS fields or not in US, and their answers are unfortunately not always accurate and sometimes leading to more confusion. So I thought it would be useful to have a document that is specific to CS PhD programs in the US from an insider prospective.

I started writing this document in May 2023 and have been updating it since then (mostly around deadline time when I tend to procrastinate, i.e., \emph{productive procrastination}!). I have put the source code of this document on \href{https://github.com/nguyenthanhvuh/phd-cs-us}{GitHub} so that anyone can contribute to it.  

\paragraph{About Me} I am an assistant professor in the CS dept at George Mason University (GMU). Prior to GMU, I was at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). I have been in the PhD admission process at GMU and UNL for many years.  Currently I serve as the program director of the MS program in Software Engineering at GMU (thus also have some experience with the MS admission process--which is quite different than PhD). My personal and lab website is at \href{https://dynaroars.github.io}{dynaroars.github.io}.

Though I'm not an international student, many of my students and collaborators are. I also mentor multiple students from Vietnam, and have close colleagues and friends who were once international students. I hope to capture the diverse challenges and experiences they've faced in this document, so that it  can be a valuable resource for prospective international students. 
Finally, my upbringing in the US provides a perspective aligned with American culture, allowing me to shed light on various issues, particularly those related to cultural differences (\autoref{sec:cultural}).
