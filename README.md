# Links for PhD students

> This collection was originally started by Paul Liang for [**current** PhD students](https://github.com/pliang279/awesome-phd-advice).  I've made it more focused on **PhD admission to CS** (but also have sections for current and graduating students).  You can contribute by sending a *pull request*.
